# Rock Paper Scissors!
# Hi and welcome to your first assignment!
Here, your goal is to create a simple "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game, with all the knowledge youv'e got so far.\
This is the **README** file. a **README** file is a text, or as you can see here, an "MD" file,\
where all of your program information (how to run, what is the input/output, and everything you think is nessecary for the understanding of your code).\
I'll give you a template this time, but from here on you'll need to manage this by yourselves. Good luck!

# (Rock Paper Scissors)
Rock paper and scissors is a game with simple rules:
